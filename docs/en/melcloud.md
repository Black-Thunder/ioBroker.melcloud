# MELCloud - User guide

## Prerequisites

In order to use this adapter, there are a few things you have to prepare in advance:

- Mitsubishi device with Wi-Fi-Adapter
- MELCloud account at the [official webpage](https://app.melcloud.com/)
- Device registered and set-up in your MELCloud account

## Upgrade notes

- In v1.1.1 the password decryption/encryption was changed. If you are upgrading from a lower version, you must enter your password again in the adapter settings. Otherwise login will fail and the adapter won't connect to the cloud.
- Starting with v1.1.3, js-controller must be installed in v3.1 or higher.
- If you are upgrading to v1.2.0 (or higher), you must completely delete all items under "melcloud.X.devices.Y.reports". Then restart the adapter for the new object structure to be created correctly. The new structure is documented below.
- Starting with v1.3.6, Node.Js 16 is required.
- Starting with v1.3.7, the minimum polling interval is limited to 5 minutes.

## Configuration

![Adapter settings](img/adapter_settings.png)
![Adapter settings 2nd tab](img/adapter_settings_tab2.png)

Here you can configure your adapter instance. Mandatory for the adapter to work are your MELCloud credentials (email address and password).

On the second tab you need to specify your account region. In addition, you can enable or disable periodic polling of data from MELCloud.
If enabled, the time interval when your device data is polled and updated from MELCloud (minimum 5 minutes to avoid being throttled by MELCloud servers). If the connection to MELCloud should fail at any time (e.g. server problem, internet connection problems), the adapter will try to reconnect up to three times. If there is still no connection after these retries, the next retry will take place after one hour.
As an advanced option, you can define whether SSL errors should be ignored when communicating with the cloud. Only activate this if you know what it means. This option is not normally required!

## Objects

After successful start of the adapter instance (X), your devices are queried by MELCloud. For each device (Y) there will be a separate node.

#### melcloud.X.devices.Y.reports

Before retrieving the power consumption reports you have to set the start ("startDate") and end date ("endDate") correctly. Please pay attention to the correct date format YYYY-MM-DD! Once these are set trigger the state "getPowerConsumptionReport".
Shortly afterwards the corresponding states in the subchannel "lastReportData" are filled with the report data from the cloud.

### melcloud.X.reports

Similiar to the device-specific reports here you can retrieve aggregated reports for all supported devices. Before retrieving the power consumption reports you again have to set the start ("startDate") and end date ("endDate") correctly. Please pay attention to the correct date format YYYY-MM-DD! Once these are set trigger the state "getCumulatedPowerConsumptionReport".
Shortly afterwards the corresponding states in the subchannel "lastReportData" are filled with the aggregated report data from the cloud.
